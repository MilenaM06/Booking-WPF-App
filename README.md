# Booking WPF Application

## About the Project

This project was developed for the **SIMS (Specification and Software Modeling)** and **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)** courses at the **Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad**.

The **Booking Application** was developed collaboratively by a team of four using **C#** and **XAML** as a **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** application. Data management was handled through **CSV** files stored in the `Resources/Database` folder. Each team member was responsible for designing and implementing the functionality for a different user role while adhering to specific requirements.

The **SIMS** aspect of the project focused on implementing **SOLID principles** and the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture. We also created sequence, activity, and use case diagrams, along with a class diagram, to better understand the data flow and application structure.

For the **HCI** part of the project, we focused on designing the application for a variety of user profiles, including those who are not technically equipped, users with color blindness, users with attention disorders, and technically skilled users with limited time and a distraction-prone environment. We incorporated additional functionalities such as demos, help options, charts for statistics, and personalization features. Different parts of the application were adjusted to meet various use cases (tablet, desktop, web application and mouse-free environments) based on project requirements.

## My Role

My task was to design and implement the interface and functionalities for accommodation owners in a mouse-free environment, specifically tailored to technically skilled users with limited time and a distraction-prone setting.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Visual Studio**: The main development environment.
- **Balsamiq Wireframes**: Used for creating low-fidelity wireframes and UI mockups.
- **draw.io**
- **PlantUML**
